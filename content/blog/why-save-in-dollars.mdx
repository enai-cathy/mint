## Why Saving in Dollars Matters

Inflation is real. In 2024, the naira lost over **30%** of its value.

That means ₦1,000 last year might only buy you ₦700 worth of goods today.

If you’re earning from Upwork, remote work, or affiliate income — saving in **dollars** protects your wealth.

   > 50% spend in ₦, 50% save in USD

2. **Avoid ATM withdrawals** for your USD account — treat it like an emergency vault.

3. **Set savings goals in dollars:**
   > Example: “I want to save $2,000 for travel by December.”

4. **Track it with tools like** the [Dual Currency Tracker](/tools) or [Net Worth Builder](/products/net-worth-builder)

##  What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don’t leave all your dollars in PayPal — it’s not secure long-term.
- ❌ Don’t hoard USD in cash. That’s risky and hard to track.
- ❌ Don’t ignore conversion fees. Always check the rate.
