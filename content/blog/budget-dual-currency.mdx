## Split Currencies, One Dashboard

Don’t just budget in naira. Use tools like our [Savings Template](/products) to plan income and expenses based on USD & NGN trends.

## 💸 Why Dual-Currency Budgeting Matters

If you’re a Nigerian freelancer, remote worker, digital nomad, or student abroad, you’ve probably received money in both **Naira (₦)** and **Dollars ($)**. But here’s the trap: budgeting only in one currency creates blind spots.

Imagine earning $200 from Upwork, ₦300,000 from a local gig, and then watching USD/NGN swing by ₦100 overnight. Without clarity, you're at risk of **overspending or undervaluing your income**.

---

##  Real-World Example

**Chika** earns:
- $500/month from international clients
- ₦200,000/month from part-time tutoring in Lagos

When she gets paid in USD and converts it to naira immediately, she feels rich. But 3 weeks later, when naira loses value, her ₦200k barely covers groceries.

With a dual-budget dashboard, she can:
- Track in both **source currencies**
- Convert at **real-time rates**
- Adjust savings goals based on **exchange fluctuations**

##  Step-by-Step: Budget Smarter Across Currencies

### 1. Separate Income Streams

Split your budget planner by:
- **USD Income:** Freelance gigs, affiliate earnings, foreign scholarships
- **NGN Income:** Salary, local clients, POS business

_This alone gives clarity._

### 2. Categorize in Native Currency

Don’t force a conversion at first. List:
- USD earnings → USD expenses (e.g. Netflix, App Store, Amazon)
- NGN earnings → NGN expenses (e.g. food, transport, rent)

Then only convert **total balances** into your preferred base currency for planning.

> ✅ Pro Tip: Choose the currency you save in as your “home currency”.

### 3. Use Tools That Support Both Currencies


| **Wise**      | Hold, spend, and convert FX at low rates |

| **PiggyVest Flex Dollar** | Save in USD, earn interest          |

| **Dual Currency Tracker (Mint Mogul)** | Sync and visualize both incomes side-by-side |

| **Google Sheets + Scripts** | DIY approach using exchange APIs |

We recommend [our own tracker](/products) because it updates rates automatically and lets you categorize by **earning region, spending type, and saving goal**.

##  Watch Out for These Mistakes

❌ **Converting too soon:** You might lose value if naira is unstable that day.  
❌ **Budgeting by feel:** Always check live rates before making big decisions.  
❌ **Saving in the wrong currency:** Match your **goals to your savings currency**. If you want to study abroad, save in USD or GBP.

##  What About Inflation?

Nigeria's inflation affects your naira. US inflation affects your dollar. Here's how to **hedge both:**


| Rent in Lagos      | Budget in **naira**, adjust monthly |

| Tuition in Canada  | Save in **dollars**, avoid surprise jumps |

| Emergency Fund     | Split: 70% in stable currency (USD), 30% local for liquidity |

---

## 🧩 Bonus Tip: Use Exchange-Rate Thresholds

When building your monthly budget, set **rate alerts**. For example:

>  _“If USD/NGN hits ₦1,600, convert $300 and top up naira savings.”_

This habit helps you stay ahead and avoid panic conversions.
